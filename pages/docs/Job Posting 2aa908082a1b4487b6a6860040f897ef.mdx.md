# Description

# Procedure

1. Check and verify the job description:
a. Use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to assess the completeness and clarity of the job description.
b. Automatically highlight any missing information or suggest improvements for better understanding by potential candidates.
2. Post the job on Manatal:
a. Integrate Manatal's API to your AI assistant. You can find their API documentation here: [https://apidocs.manatal.com/](https://apidocs.manatal.com/).
b. Develop a script or workflow within your AI assistant that automatically uploads the job description to Manatal, along with needed details like job title, location, and other relevant fields.
3. Create Canva content:
a. Connect your AI assistant to Canva using its API ([https://www.canva.com/developers/](https://www.canva.com/developers/)).
b. Develop a script that generates visuals for the job post based on the job title, description, and company branding guidelines.
c. Export the created visual from Canva in a suitable format like PNG or JPEG.
4. Upload the job post to LinkedIn:
a. Obtain access to LinkedIn's Marketing Developer Platform and integrate the necessary API endpoints with your AI assistant ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/)).
b. Use the script or workflow you created to post the job along with the Canva graphic, key job details, and other relevant information to LinkedIn Jobs.

Additionally, to track the mentioned KPIs:

- Initial posting date: Record the date when the job posting is published on both Manatal and LinkedIn. This can be done using the workflow created during the posting steps.
- Insights of each job post: Access analytics provided by Manatal and LinkedIn to gather metrics such as the number of views, clicks, and applications for each job post. Integrate this data into your AI assistant to develop automated reports.
- Length/budget for job open: Set a tracking mechanism to monitor the length of time each job post remains active and to determine the total budget spent on promoting the job. This could be achieved using API data from Manatal and LinkedIn, as well as internal systems for job promotion costs.
