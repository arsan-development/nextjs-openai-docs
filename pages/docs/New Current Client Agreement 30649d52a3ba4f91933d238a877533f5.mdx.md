# Description

- [x]  Automate the process of sending secure contracts to new clients while maintaining confidentiality and privacy.

# Procedure

1. Create a secure contract template: Design a contract template that is comprehensive and includes all the necessary clauses and provisions required for your new clients. Ensure the template is easily editable to accommodate any specific changes for each client.
2. Automate contract document creation: Leverage Microsoft Power Automate to create a flow that triggers when a new client is added to your system. This flow should utilize the 'Populate a Microsoft Word template' action, which enables you to fill designated placeholders within your contract template with relevant client information automatically.
3. Implement digital signatures: To ensure secure and legally binding signing of contracts, adopt a digital signature platform such as DocuSign or Adobe Sign. Both of these platforms have connectors for Power Automate, which enables seamless integration with your existing document automation process. By sending the contract through the digital signature platform, you can ensure that the document is encrypted and secure, and your clients can sign electronically.
4. Send the contract via email: Once your contract is filled in and ready for signature, simply use the connector (Gmail or Outlook) in Power Automate to automatically send the secure contract document to the new client. You can also create an email template that includes instructions on how to sign and return the contract using the digital signature platform.
5. Streamline internal communication with Microsoft Teams: Utilize Power Automate to create a flow that sends a notification to a Microsoft Teams channel or chat once the contract has been signed by the client. This will help keep your team informed and up-to-date on the contract status.
