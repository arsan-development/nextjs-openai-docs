# Visio Flowchart

To sketch out the steps in Microsoft Visio and create a flowchart, follow these instructions:

1. Open Microsoft Visio and create a new blank drawing or select a relevant flowchart template.
2. Add shapes to represent each step by dragging the necessary shapes from the Shapes pane (e.g., rectangles for actions, diamonds for decisions) onto the drawing area.
3. Connect the shapes using arrow lines to indicate the flow of the process. To do this, drag the "Dynamic Connector" from the Shapes pane and release it when it connects two shapes.
4. Add labels to the shapes to represent each step of your process:
    
    For example, create the following flow:
    
    a. Start (Oval shape)
    
    b. Prepare required documents (Rectangle shape)
    
    i. Agreement (Rectangle shape)
    
    ii. Compensation (Rectangle shape)
    
    iii. Reasons for leaving (Rectangle shape)
    
    c. Save documents to SharePoint (Rectangle shape)
    
    d. Automate document sending (Rectangle shape)
    
    i. Integrate askARSAN with Outlook (Rectangle shape)
    
    ii. Set up flow for emailing candidate (Rectangle shape)
    
    e. Monitor document completion (Rectangle shape)
    
    i. Track submission status (Rectangle shape)
    
    ii. Use email tracking features (Rectangle shape)
    
    f. Implement push notifications (Rectangle shape)
    
    i. Create notification system in askARSAN (Rectangle shape)
    
    ii. Notify relevant team members (Rectangle shape)
    
    g. End (Oval shape)
    
5. Customize the appearance of the flowchart by adjusting the color, style, and shapes to align with your organization's branding or preferred format.
6. Save the Visio file (e.g., .vsdx), and if required, export the flowchart to a more accessible format like PDF or an image file (e.g., .PNG). This can be shared with your team through SharePoint, email, or other collaboration tools.
