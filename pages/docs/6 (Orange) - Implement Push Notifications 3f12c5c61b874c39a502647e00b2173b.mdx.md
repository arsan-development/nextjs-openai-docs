# 6 (Orange) - Implement Push Notifications

- In Power Apps, create a mechanism for triggering push notifications on completed submissions.
i. Utilize the Power Apps Notification connector ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-notification)) to show in-app notifications.
ii. Configure the app to notify recruiters and other relevant team members through their preferred channels (e.g., email, Microsoft Teams) using Power Automate flows.
