# Description

- [x]  Streamline the process for sending a semi-automated email template of recommendations.

# Procedure

1. Send a semi-automated email template.
2. Creating a detailed email for the candidate with tips and recommendations for their first interview.
3. Integrate email platform with Power Apps: Connect your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) with Power Apps by adding the relevant connector. This will enable seamless communication between your email application and your Power App. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this based on your email service in Microsoft's documentation.
4. Create an email template: Design an email template with placeholders for information you want to customize, such as the candidate's name, specific tips, or anything else you feel is relevant. Make sure it follows your preferred format and is easily editable by the assistant or yourself when required.
5. Automate filling in the placeholders: Use Power Apps' capabilities to create custom logic that populates the placeholders in your email template with relevant data. This will give your assistant a head-start when drafting the email, saving time, and ensuring consistency.
6. Implement the Kaizen process: To implement the Kaizen process, have your assistant automatically create the email when a new job request is initiated. This way, the draft will be ready before the candidate's first interview. You can do this using Power Automate, which works well with Power Apps.
7. Add a review step: Before the email is sent, include a review step where either you or someone else in the team can double-check the email and make sure it's tailored to the candidate's needs. This can help maintain quality and consistency across all communications.
